					<p class="content__text">Music is a direct impression of the person himself, his own thoughts, emotions, intellectual abilities and his subconscious world. For each person, there are different genres in music that would satisfy the listener.
					</p>
					<p class="content__text">Music is a harmonious combination of individual sounds. Each sound has a different effect on a person's consciousness. Thanks to the combination of sounds, the musician manages to give listeners a sense of impulse and emotion. He combines sounds in a special way, which distinguishes his work from all the others, because of the author's attitude to the choice of instruments for his work. Basically, musical ranges are characterized by an increase in the mood of the listener, at the same time causing sadness and melancholy, although insignificant, but can lead the listener to depression. Certain tones evoke other moods in accordance with the rhythm in which the music is expressed.
					</p>
					<p class="content__text">Therefore, this site presents compositions by several artists in the genre of Drum'n'bass, Techstep and Techno, so that everyone can immerse themselves in reflections while listening to songs from the band Nero, feel the dynamics and speed of the tracks of the band Pendulum or cheer themselves up with a couple of drum and chainsaw sounds from Current Value;)
