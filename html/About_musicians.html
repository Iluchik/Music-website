						<h1 class="about__title">Pendulum</h1>
						<div class="about__history">
							<p>Pendulum is an Australian drum and bass band formed in 2002 in Perth by Rob Swire, Gareth McGrillen and Paul Harding.</p>
							<p>Swire and McGrillen were members of the metal band Oxygen, but after listening to Konflict's performance, they were inspired by drum and bass. They founded the band Pendulum together with Harding, a DJ familiar with the drum and bass scene. In 2003, the band moved to the UK.</p>
							<p>Although the album Hold Your Colour was designed in the genre of drum and bass, later Pendulum began to experiment with a musical style, which was reflected in the albums In Silico and Immersion, where elements of alternative rock and heavy metal, dubstep, industrial, hard rock and house appeared.</p>

						<h1 class="about__title">Nero</h1>
						<div class="about__history">
							<p>Nero is a British electronic duo playing in the styles of electro-house, techno, drum and bass and dubstep. Originated in London, it consists of Dan Stevens and Joe Ray. Alana Watson performs lead vocals on many of the duo's tracks.</p>
							<p>Ray and Stevens were born in 1984. Ray grew up in Northwood, London, while Stevens grew up in Notting Hill. The boys met Watson when they turned 18. Ray played acoustic guitar, and Stevens played cello with the support of his father, who was a jazz musician. At the age of 17, Stevens attended a specialized music school in Pimlico. Outside of school, both friends made electronic music on their home computers. They first started working together at the age of 17, setting up a studio in Stevens' bedroom.</p>
							<p>Nero's debut release was "Space 2001" as part of the three-layer vinyl record "Straight Outta Leicester" on Reformed Recordings in 2004. Watson began to participate in the recording of Nero tracks since 2008, namely with the tracks "Solid Air" and "This Way", which were their debut compositions in the dubstep genre.</p>
